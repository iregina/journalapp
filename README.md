> Increasing the value of journaling by lowering the barriers to action

Most journal apps are designed as “a place for user to keep their secret and private thoughts.”

We've created an app designed to help you remember the details of your life first — with the notion of protecting private thoughts secondary.
Given the change in mindset from “harboring secrets” to “remembering more things,” we'll be adding a social component to help increase engagement.
